      <div class="sec3txt-img">
          <div class="sec3text">
              <p>At Him Village ePrahari, our mission is deeply rooted in the preservation of the Himalayas, an irreplaceable ecosystem that sustains countless lives. We are dedicated to protecting this vital environment by addressing the pressing challenges of waste management, climate change, and environmental degradation. Our initiatives focus on creating zero-waste villages, implementing effective waste management models, and promoting sustainable practices that can be adopted by communities throughout the region. We believe that every village and individual has the potential to be a guardian of the environment, and our mission is to empower them to take action. Through education, we aim to instill a sense of responsibility in the next generation, ensuring that they are equipped with the knowledge and resources needed to protect their surroundings.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Beyond environmental protection, our mission extends to the empowerment of local communities, particularly those in rural areas where resources are scarce. We strive to improve the standard of education, provide essential learning tools, and offer career counseling to children, helping them build a brighter future. Our efforts also include supporting rag pickers' families by providing educational opportunities and developing earning models for environmental volunteers. By fostering a sense of stewardship and community-driven change, Him Village ePrahari is committed to creating a sustainable and resilient future for the Himalayas and its people. Together, we can safeguard the natural beauty and cultural heritage of this region, ensuring that it remains a lifeline for generations to come.</p>
